    question: "2. What can I learn on this website?",
    answer:
      "An-Nahdah offers a wide range of courses covering the Prophet's Seerah, Islamic history, lives of the Sahabah, ethics, and character development.

Certificates serve as recognition of the learner's knowledge and effort.",

    answer:
      "Most of An-Nahdah's courses and content are completely free to ensure that authentic Islamic education is accessible to everyone. However, some premium courses, special workshops, or certificate programs may require a small subscription fee. This fee helps maintain high-quality content, support course instructors, and ensure continuous development of new resources. Even for premium courses, An-Nahdah provides detailed previews and trial lessons so learners can assess the content before subscribing.",

Each topic is presented as a lesson with clear explanations, real-life examples, and practical applications. Learners progress through lessons step by step, completing quizzes, assignments, and discussion sessions designed to reinforce understanding. This method ensures that knowledge is not only memorized but also internalized and applied in daily life. Learners can revisit lessons, track their progress, and engage in peer discussions to deepen comprehension.",
  },
  {
    question: "6. Can I learn using my mobile device?",
    answer:
      "Yes! An-Nahdah is fully responsive and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The platform allows you to learn anytime and anywhere, whether commuting, at home, or at work. The mobile interface is designed for readability and smooth navigation, with appropriately sized cards, text, and interactive elements.

In addition, lessons include explanations, examples, and visuals to reinforce comprehension for learners who may not be fluent in English.",
